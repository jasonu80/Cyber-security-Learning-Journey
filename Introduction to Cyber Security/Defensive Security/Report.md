My Thought Process on the hands-on lab:
1. Using a SIEM tool provided by TryHackMe to identify malicious alerts
2. Utilising an IP scanner to gather more information about the threat actor
3. Choosing the right person in the security role to report the incident
4. Using a firewall blocker to block the malicious IP address

### Underlying Concepts
Defensive Security is a type of cyber or digital security, in which is the reverse of offensive security, that aims to prevent, detect, and respond to any intrusions to occur inside of a computer application and/or system. There are a number of possible careers inside defensive security, such as ***Security Operation Center (SOC), Threat Intelligence, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), Malware Analysis, and Cyber Security Analyst, one of the most popular entry level of cyber security***. This type of digital security contains one of the field that has a lot of job types. These roles are crucial in Cyber Security because they are the ones who safeguards the system. There are a number of different responsibilities that these different roles have done, explained below:
1. **Increasing cyber security awareness** - Train clients about cyber security to protect against attacks targetting their systems.
2. **Documenting and managing assets** - Adequately document, record, manage, and protect any systems and devices of a user/client.
3. **Updating and patching systems** - Making sure that all systems are up to date within the latest version and patched against any known vulnerabilities
4. **Setting up any preventive security devices** - Preventive security devices such as Firewall and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) need to be setup correctly to protect the network from malicious actors.
5. **Setting up logging and monitoring devices** - To be able to view any unauthorised device in a network, it is crucial for a security analyst to detect and log the activities of the device.
Also, here are a simple and brief explanation of each role mentioned above:
- **Security Operation Center (SOC)** - Monitor network and systems to detect any suspicious cyber security events and/or incidents
- **Threat Intelligence** - Gathers information to help the company prepare against potential risks of a cyber attack.
- **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** - Broken down into these sections:
  - **Digital Forensics** - Analyse any evidence of the cyber attack.
  - **Incident Response** - Reduce the damage caused by the cyber attack and recover it within the shortest time possible, to keep the operation running.
  - **Malware Analysis** - Learn about malicious programs with a number of purposes:
    - **Static Analysis** - Inspect the malicious program without actually running the program itself
    - **Dynamic Analysis** - Running the malicious program in the sandbox environment and monitor the activities.

### Hands-on lab process & thoughts
This lab will be broken down into several images and includes any explanations of the image itself.
