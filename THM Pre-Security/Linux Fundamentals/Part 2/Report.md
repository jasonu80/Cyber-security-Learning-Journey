## How does this topic relates with Cyber Security Business

## Underlying concepts with security relevance

#### SSH 

Secure shell or SSH is a protocol that are encrypted to connect between two different devices.

*Security Relevance*: Make sure that the client has implemented cyber hygiene when connecting 2 different devices, for example: If device A wants to connect to device B via SSH, then implementing a unique and long password are the security principles. 

**Possible threats and mitigation**: The SSH port can be checked using a tool called `nmap`, whether it is opened or not based on the results that the tool shows. One possible mitigation is to perform a hardening on the device, which is disable certain features that the device has enabled by default.
